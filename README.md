### Purpose

The Tradesman Job Management application is designed to streamline and enhance the work
processes of tradesmen. It aims to address the unique challenges faced by tradesmen in 
managing their jobs, schedules, clients, and resources.


### Functionality / features

Admin will have access to the number of registered users. There's also a potential feature for user registration confirmation, which may require a background worker depending on the processing load.
- **Job Management**: Tradesmen can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) job entries with details like job location, type of work, materials needed, estimated time, cost, etc.
- **Schedule Management**: A CRUD calendar feature, leveraging react-big-calendar, allows tradesmen to schedule their jobs, set reminders, and mark their availability.
- **Client Management**: A CRUD database of clients with their contact information, job history, and feedback or ratings for completed jobs.
- **User Profile**: A feature to view and update user details, including contact information, profile picture, and password.
- **Search and Filter**: A search bar and filter options to find specific jobs, clients, or inventory items quickly.
- **Dashboard**: A dashboard to view a summary of jobs, schedules, clients, and user profile details.


### Target audience

The application targets blue-collar tradesmen who need a comprehensive solution to manage their work processes.


### Tech stack

This application is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

## R4 - User Stories

**Job Management**
- As a tradesman, I have a new job lined up. I open the app and go to the job creation page. I fill in
the job details such as location, type of work, materials needed, estimated time, cost, etc., and submit
the job entry. Now, I have a digital record of my job. Over time, I update these job entries as things 
change, ensuring my job list is always current. If a job gets cancelled or completed, I can easily 
delete it from my list. I can also view my current, pending, and completed jobs, as well as filter them
by date, location, or type of work in a search bar. This will come in handy when I need to find a specific
job to compare details such as cost or materials needed as reference.


**Schedule Management**
- Managing my schedule is important for me as a tradesman. With the app, I can go to the calendar feature,
select the date and time for each job, and save the job schedule. I also set reminders for my jobs, so I 
don't miss any. This way, I can organize my work and manage my time effectively.

**Client Management**
- Keeping track of my clients is essential. With the app, I can add a new client with their contact 
information and save it. I can update my clients' information as needed, ensuring it's always current.
If a client is no longer relevant, I can easily delete them from my client list.


**User Profile**

- As a tradesman, I want to have a comprehensive and accessible profile. I open the app and navigate
to the user profile page. Here, I can view my contact information, profile picture, and other 
personal details. If I need to update any of this information, such as changing my phone number or
updating my profile picture, I can easily do so within the app. I also have the option to change 
my password if needed, ensuring my account remains secure. This feature allows me to maintain an 
up-to-date and accurate profile, which is essential for managing my professional image
